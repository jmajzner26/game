# Mountain Drifter

**Genre:** Racing / Physics / Driving Simulation

**Core Gameplay Loop:** Drive â†’ Drift â†’ Earn points â†’ Upgrade â†’ Unlock new cars & tracks

## Concept

Race and drift through breathtaking mountain roads with realistic physics, cinematic camera angles, and rewarding progression. Players start with a simple car and work their way up by mastering challenging downhill tracks, earning reputation, and unlocking high-performance drift machines.

Think of it as a fusion between Initial D, Art of Rally, and CarX Drift Racing â€” fast, stylish, and skill-based.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ® Driving & Physics
- Realistic but fun drift physics with adjustable traction, tire grip, and weight shift
- Manual or automatic transmission options
- Handbrake drifting, clutch kick, and feint drift mechanics
- Dynamic camera that shifts and shakes during drifts for cinematic feel
- Replay mode for highlight videos and social sharing

### ðŸŒ„ Tracks & Environments
- Beautiful mountain passes inspired by Japan, the Alps, and California canyons
- Weather and time-of-day effects (foggy dawns, sunsets, night runs, rain)
- Procedural skid marks, drifting smoke, and environmental soundscapes
- Shortcuts and scenic overlooks hidden along the route

### ðŸš— Progression System
- Earn drift points and money for style, speed, and combos
- Buy and tune new cars: upgrade engine, suspension, tires, weight, and cosmetics
- Unlock new tracks and events as skill increases
- Optional free roam mode for practice and exploration

### ðŸ’° Customization & Tuning
- Deep car customization (paint jobs, decals, spoilers, wheels)
- Adjustable tuning sliders for handling and drift balance
- Garage menu to preview and test settings

### ðŸŽ§ Sound & Style
- Synthwave / chill electronic soundtrack
- Realistic sound mixing (engine roars, tire squeals, echo in tunnels)
- Minimalist UI with speedometer, RPM, gear, and drift score combo meter

## Art Direction

Stylized low-poly realism â€” crisp geometry, soft fog layers, and warm sunlight for immersive depth.

Think Art of Rally meets Polytrack: clean yet atmospheric.

Use post-processing (bloom, depth of field, motion blur) for cinematic immersion.

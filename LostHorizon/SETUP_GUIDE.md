     - PlayerInventory
     - EquipmentManager
   - Add a Camera as a child of Player
   - Tag the Player GameObject as "Player"

5. **Setup GameManager**
   - Create an empty GameObject named "GameManager"
   - Add component: GameManager
   - Assign references to all systems (PlayerController, WorldManager, etc.)

6. **Setup World**
   - Create an empty GameObject named "WorldManager"
   - Add component: WorldManager
   - Add component: WeatherSystem
   - Add a Directional Light for the sun

7. **Create Resource Nodes**
   - Create a GameObject for each resource type (trees, rocks, etc.)
   - Add ResourceNode component
   - Set ResourceType, MaxResources, and HarvestTime
   - Add Collider (BoxCollider or SphereCollider)

8. **Create UI**
   - Create a Canvas in your scene
   - Create UI for GameHUD (health bars, stamina, etc.)
   - Create UI panels for Inventory, Crafting, and Building menus

- Set up layers for ground, resources, buildings, etc.
- Use tags for identifying interactable objects
- Test each system individually before integrating
- Start with simple prefabs and iterate

## Troubleshooting

**Scripts not compiling?**
- Check that all namespaces are correct
- Ensure Unity version is 2022.3 LTS or later
- Check Console for specific errors

**Player not moving?**
- Ensure CharacterController is added
- Check Input System package is installed
- Verify Input Actions are set up correctly

**Resources not harvesting?**
- Check ResourceNode has a Collider
- Verify player is close enough (3 units)
- Ensure correct tool type is equipped

**Buildings not placing?**
- Check BuildingPlacement is on GameManager or separate GameObject
- Verify ground layer mask is set correctly
- Ensure player has required resources
